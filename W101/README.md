Hi! Thanks for using my program, in the future I plan on making a very upgraded version of this. 

Now to explain how to use it!

1. Set the game to the resolution you have in settings.txt and make sure that settings.txt is in the same folder as the executable (.exe file)

2. Get into a battle with the mob you want to farm

3. Launch the program and switch back to the game

4. Leave the program running for as long as you want

5. To exit the program you have to click on the window and click the red 'x' button

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should probably explain 'Settings.txt'. 

The first line of settings.txt is '0 x 0'. 

This line is supposed to be where you put the resolution that you play the game on. 

For example, I usually play with the resolution 1368 x 766. 

Thus I would put '1368 x 766' where '0 x 0' is. 

*PLEASE NOTE* there is a space between the numbers and the 'x', THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT!!!

The second line is just the number '7'. 

This line indicates the number of cards in your deck. 

I recommend only having 3 cards in your deck. 

Just replace '7' with the number of cards in your deck. 

*ALSO VERY IMPORTANT* Please only put aoe hits in your deck (no enchants or anything else)


Thanks and Have FUN!
