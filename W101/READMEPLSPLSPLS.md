Hi! Thanks for using my program, in the future I plan on making a very upgraded version of this.
Well, moving on, I should probably explain Settings.txt
The first line of settings.txt is '0 x 0'
This line is supposed to be where you put the resolution that you play the game on
For example, I usually play with the resolution 1368 x 766
Thus I would put '1368 x 766' where '0 x 0' is
The second line is just the number '7'
This line indicates the number of cards in your deck
I recommend only having 3 cards in your deck
Just replace '7' with the number of cards in your deck

Thanks and Have FUN!
